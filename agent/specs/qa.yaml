name: qa_verification

objectives:
  - Verify that the generated tests pass successfully; if they fail, diagnose the issue,
    update the refactored code or tests as needed, and rerun the relevant pipeline steps.
  - Confirm that documentation under `refactored/documentation/` matches the latest code (no stale module names or behaviors).
  - Produce a short QA report summarizing checks and actions taken.

process_requirements:
  - Work from the outputs in `refactored/` (modules, tests, documentation, reasoning artifacts).
  - When a change is needed (code, tests, or docs), regenerate the affected parts and re-run
    `task test` to ensure regressions pass before proceeding.
  - Continue iterating until tests pass and documentation is consistent.

artifacts:
  - Write a final QA summary to `refactored/reasoning_artifacts/qa_report.md` describing:
    * Test run status (pass/fail, reruns).
    * Files that were modified and why.
    * Confirmation that documentation reflects the current refactor.
  - Do not create additional packages or files under `refactored/qa_verification`; the report goes only in reasoning_artifacts.
