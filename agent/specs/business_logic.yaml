name: business_logic_review

modules:
  - name: billing
    legacy: legacy/billing.py
    refactored: refactored/billing_refactor
    questions:
      - What business rules drive pricing, discounts, shipping, and tax?
      - Which assumptions or thresholds are embedded (e.g., shipping threshold 100, tax 22%)?
      - Where could future extensions plug in?
  - name: subscriptions
    legacy: legacy/subscriptions.py
    refactored: refactored/subscriptions_refactor
    questions:
      - How do plans, addons, coupons, and base fees interact?
      - What are the invariants (clamping to zero, default overage fee)?
      - How does the refactored design expose configurability?

deliverables:
  - For each module, create a **single** Markdown file at
    `refactored/documentation/business_logic/<name>.md` (no packages, no extra files)
    covering:
      * Overview of the business process.
      * Key rules & thresholds.
      * Data flow between submodules.
      * Extension points / open questions.
